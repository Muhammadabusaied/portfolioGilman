                        <p className="text-justify">
                            Greetings! I'm Ahsan Gilman. I am a dedicated student of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, with a deep passion for the rapidly evolving field of metagenomics. My academic journey has allowed me to develop a solid foundation in veterinary science, while my research interests have expanded into the intersection of animal health, microbiology, and cutting-edge genomic technologies.

                        <p className="text-justify">
                        In my current research, I focus on metagenomics, a field that explores the genetic material of microbial communities within specific environments, without the need for traditional culturing methods. This is particularly important in veterinary medicine, as the health of animals is closely tied to the microbiomes they host. By analyzing the genetic diversity of microbial populations, I aim to uncover insights into how these organisms influence animal health, disease resistance, and overall well-being.

                        <p className="text-justify">
                        My research primarily involves the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics tools, and advanced statistical methods to analyze microbial communities. One of the key aspects of my work is the investigation of microbial diversity through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a method widely used to study bacterial taxonomy and phylogeny.
